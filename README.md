Deterministic offline password generator (better than any online password manager). Ships as a single self-contained HTML file that you can safely run on a USB drive. Creates safe passwords for any number of usernames on a website (Argon2id + domain/label/version). No need to remember or save any passwords. It reliably and safely recreates them.
